Simple Version of Blackjack created to practise and learn functions of VB.NET as well as Visual Studio.

Added a pirate flair to the game to add some personality and allow for me to play around with more creative design elements of the project.

Project was initially based around the first project in this VB.NET Blackjack guide: https://www.codeguru.com/visual-basic/creating-a-blackjack-game-in-visual-basic/
